            <p>
            this one is a diferent birb
            <br>
            its a falcon, <strong>Peregrine falcon</strong> in fact
            <br>he can also do birb things
            <br>he <b>flies</b>
            <br>he <b>eats</b>  
            <br>he <b>hangout on trees</b>
            <br>but he is special cause he is <strong>THE FASTEST ANIMAL ON EARTH</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            well not quite the fast flyer but he is smart
            he uses <em>pyhsics</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            he would fly around looking for a target. mouse n stuff probably
            i would know if i did a proper reserch but meh
            </p>
            <p>
            so after locking in, he would fly high and then 
            swoop down using the gravity to increase his speed
            </p>
            <p>
            he goes to likeover 300 km/h?? i believe. which is like super fast.
            for reference that is as fast as car on highway. car brand / type not specified :p. just know its as fast as car
            </p>
            <p>
            he is just him. fast birb, probably smart too since he know how to use physics
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>ohayou sekai good morning world ~</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            that's all i know about this birb tho. sooo yea the end?
            </p>
